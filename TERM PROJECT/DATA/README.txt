Summary
=======
This is a sample of the Microsoft Research Asia Geolife GPS Trajectory Dataset (Version 1.3). 
The original dataset contains over 17,000 trajectories recorded by 182 users from April 2007 to August 2012, covering 1.29 million kilometers and 50,000+ hours of movement. 
Each trajectory is a time-stamped sequence of latitude, longitude, and altitude points, and a subset includes transportation mode labels such as walking, biking, bus, car, train, and airplane
